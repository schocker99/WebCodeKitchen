# WebCodeKitchen

This repository was created for the course 'Web Code Kitchen' at FHNW.
Owner: Adrian Miller

## 1. Introduction

The aim is to create a simple web application that should act as a place for me to display my cv as well as my past coding projects.
The application should be built using only vanilla html/js/css and should be hosted on github pages.
Furthermore, there should be a commit for every 30 minutes of time spent coding on the project.
